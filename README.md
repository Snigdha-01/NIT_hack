<p><h2><a id="index1"></a>About The Project</h2></p>
Cyclofit is a safety and health monitoring system for cyclists. <br><br>
It tracks the heart rate,calories burnt, distance coverered and much more using the sensors integrated in a single device.Our device has a proximity sensor that can track 
any incoming vehicle by monitoring it's rate of change of speed. The data such as the heart rate are displayed into the app through an api.

<p><h2><a id="index2"></a>‚ú® Features</h2></p>
Our website has many essential features to track and analyse the performance of a cyclist: <br><br>
1. The Home page of our app has a timer that tracks the calories burnt in that given time. <br><br>
2. We have a community page that allows a user to create and join a community which allows him to track everything that has been cooking in that particular community<br><br>
3. The Health section provides the cyclists with an overview of everything that our app has to offer. There a 3 graphs in this particular section to visualise the data in a more effective manner<br><br>
4. A leaderboard allows the user to see where he stands in comparison to his peers
